In our paper "An Exploratory Study of Performance Regression Introducing Code Changes" (ICSME 2017), due to limited space, we do only show the number of tests that have performance regression and improvement for each commit measured using response time. So, we will show the results for other metrics, CPU, Memory, I/O read and I/O write. Besides, we also share our orignal data online for the continue research.
